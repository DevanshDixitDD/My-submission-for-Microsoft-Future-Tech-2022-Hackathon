1. This is the figma version of our smart city app, which will be rewritten in the flutter framework soon.
2. Users of this app can provide administrative staff with comprehensive reports on the smart city.
3. There have been reports of things like a damaged road, malfunctioning traffic lights, and a tense situation between two groups of people, etc...

4. Users may include images and their precise location in these reports to the control panel.
5. All reports are visible to the administrator, and their locations are shown on a map.
6. There is also a panic button that, when pressed, immediately notifies both the system administrator and the user's preselected list of emergency contacts of a critical situation.
7. And once the situation is under control, the admin can delete the reports.
